- Recently, Brazil has faced a series of disasters that have caused immensurable impacts the environment and its biodiversity, as well as social and economic damage. Two recent examples, both of common origin, refer to the rupture of the ore rejection dams in Mariana and Brumadinho occurred in the years 2015 and 2019, respectively. Such events provoked a series of deaths as well as irreparable damage to society and the environment. Technological disasters like these motivate the development of strategies and tools capable of assisting in the systematic monitoring of areas that pose risks to society. In this context, Remote Sensing appears as an extremely useful technology in the monitoring process, since it allows for extensive analysis in space and in a multitemporal way.

- Still, in the scope of the development of monitoring tools, the techniques of Learning of
Machine stands out with another component of great importance. When combined with the data obtained
by remote sensing, such techniques enable the extraction and representation of information in a
automated over the Earth's surface.

- Among different techniques that permeate Machine Learning, the detection of anomalies allows the identification of events / elements that are at odds with a set of observations. Conceptually,
techniques of this nature are shown to be a convenient alternative in monitoring activities.
In view of the problem presented, this research project proposes the implementation of a prototype
system for monitoring and alerts on areas containing tailings dams mining. The use of multitemporal series of images obtained by Remote Sensing and Machine Learning techniques make up the core of this proposal. As a case study, we will analyze the dams contained in the municipalities of Itabira, Nova Lima, Mariana and Brumadinho, with respect to periods from its construction to the year 2020.

- ðŸŒŽ This research project has the general goal of implementing a system prototype designed to
monitoring of ore tailings dam regions using multitemporal series of images obtained by remote sensing and Machine Learning techniques. As specific objectives, the following are outlined: (a) development of an automated procedure for acquisition of multitemporal series of images according to region of study, period and quality parameters; (b) integration of multitemporal data in Machine Learning methods for the purpose of anomaly detection; (c) verification of the stability of the regions / dams observed through multitemporal maps on the occurrence of anomalies; (d) publication of the results obtained at events and scientific journals.
